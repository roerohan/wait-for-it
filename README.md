<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<img src="./assets/wait-for-it.png" alt="wait-for-it" width="800">

This package is adapted from [vishnubob/wait-for-it](https://github.com/vishnubob/wait-for-it), a popular project used to wait for TCP connections until a service is up. This is commonly used in `docker-compose` files to make one service wait for another, for example, to make a web server wait for a `mysql` database.

Since [vishnubob/wait-for-it](https://github.com/vishnubob/wait-for-it) is a bash script, it does not work directly with minimal containers like [scratch](https://hub.docker.com/_/scratch), which are commonly used to run binaries.

With the help of this package, you can generate a binary, which can run inside minimal Docker containers and wait for a TCP connection such as a `mysql` database. You can find an example here: [csivitu/bl0b](https://github.com/csivitu/bl0b/blob/master/docker-compose.yml).


### Built With

* [Go](https://golang.org/)



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

A `amd64` (64-bit) executables for `linux`, `darwin`, and `windows` are available in the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/roerohan/wait-for-it/releases/).

If you want to build a binary for a different Operating System / Architecture, you can follow the procedure below.

### Prerequisites

The only prerequisite is `golang` which you can get [here](https://golang.org/).

* go

### Installation
 
1. Get the package using `go install`.
```bash
go install github.com/roerohan/wait-for-it
```

Alternatively, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/roerohan/wait-for-it
```

2. Build a go binary from source.
```bash
cd wait-for-it
go build -o ./bin/wait-for-it
```

3. Use the binary inside the bin folder.
```bash
./bin/wait-for-it google.com:80 -- echo "It works\!"
```


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

The usage is similar to [vishnubob/wait-for-it](https://github.com/vishnubob/wait-for-it).

Use `wait-for-it -h` to display the following list.

```
Usage of wait-for-it:
  -q    Quiet, don't output any status messages
  -s    Only execute subcommand if the test succeeds
  -t int
        Timeout in seconds, zero for no timeout (default 15)
  -w host:port
        Services to be waiting for, in the form host:port
```

You can run any executable after passing ` -- `, like in the examples below.

### Examples:

1. Waiting for multiple services in parallel.

```sh
wait-for-it -w google.com:80 -w localhost:27017 -t 30 -- echo "Waiting for 30 seconds for google.com:80 and localhost:27017"
```

2. Strict mode will not execute the subcommand only if TCP connection was successful.

```sh
$ wait-for-it -w abcd:80 -s -t 5 -- echo "Done\!"
wait-for-it: waiting 5 seconds for abcd:80
wait-for-it: timeout occured after waiting for 5 seconds
wait-for-it: strict mode, refusing to execute subprocess
```
